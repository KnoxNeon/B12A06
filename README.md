#### 1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?
        var, let and const are all variable declaration techniques in JS whereas var is function-scoped meaning it can only be used inside the function where it was called and let and const are blocked-scoped meaning they work inside { }.


#### 2) What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()? 
        map(), forEach() and filter() are all  array iteration methods in JS. map() changes each element and creates a new array. forEach() runs a function on each element but does not create a new array. filter() filters elements based on given condition.

#### 3) What are arrow functions in ES6?
        arrow functions are a new and shorter way of writing functions in ES6.

#### 4) How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?
        Destructuring assignment lets us extract values from arrays or objects into separate variables.


#### 5) Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?
        Template literals are newer way to work with strings in ES6 where strings are enclosed by backticks(``) instead of quotes("") and it can also be multi-line where string concatenation is single line and needs extra \n for multi-lines.
